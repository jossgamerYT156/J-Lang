# J-IDE 0.0.1A (GCC / C++)

**This program is part of the J-Lang Side-Project.**

**Made on Qt Creator for simplicity. and ease to read using C++ language.**

**The  J-IDE is directly developed from the IDE version of the same J-Lang.**
**With a slightly improved and better structured for GUI applications.**

**i have to add that this is a Pseudo-Programming-Language of sorts.**
**It just intends to be fun to use and randomly nice for users to read :)**

Functions:
> - Create simple dialog boxes with title and custom content.
> - Create simple warning boxes with title and custom content.
> - Print messages to a emulated terminal.
> - Open web links on the default system browser.
> - Create simple Child-Windows with a single function(Still on BETA).

**Many more to be added soon**

Syntax examples:
Printing messages
```
print(")
```
> there's no need for a double quote, though you can add it if you prefer.

Opening a browser:
> a browser window can easily be opened by using.
```
browser("https://www.somewhere.in/theinternet/)
```

Creating a dialog box:
> a dialog box can easily be created by using the `notif` function.
> notif is a shortening for "Notify", since that's what we're doing.
```
notif(title, content!)
```
Creating a dialog box:
> a Warning box can easily be created by using the `warn` function.
> Warn states that an error or function could not be found.
> this can appear when using an unknown function in the code, or by misspelling a function.
> a warn can easily be created by doing.
```
warn(warning title, Warning! Content.)
```

Comments:
> any line starting with `*` or `//` will be ignored as a comment.
> and won't be executed.

Beta Features;
Creating Child Windows:


a child window will be created by using:
```
window(create([width-height]), "Title", "Content")
```

# Disclaimer:

This is a project made for fun, it doesn't plan or intends to replace any real Programming Language out there.

We're just trying to have fun here and see what we can do with a bit of C++ and a lot of free time.

J-Lang is supposed to be easy to read, so, tell me if it seems overwhelming, so i can abstract and make it more understandable for everyone!

JDS:
Create!
Have Fun!
Learn New Things Everyday!


# Special Thanks

Special Thanks to everyone contributing to this project, but specially to:

- Techlm77:
           The nice developer who somehow always believes in me

- Tia:
      The babe with the power! and a great motivator!
  
- Hugh:
      The Technomancer, who is really good at code and has served me as a very good example of what a good C/C++ developer is like.

- You All:
         For being here and help the project with your downloads and comments!





From Lilly to the world... let's have fun and learn together!



# - Lilly Dev!
LillyDev is a mexican developer who enjoys crazy ideas and overwhelming amounts of Tea.

The developer of J-Lang and more projects like it.

Starting to develop publicly since 2022 for simple projects like:
- J Window Manager
- J Desktop Environment
- J-Lang
- J-OS(Just an Operative System / OS)
- And helped on the development of the [Joss Subdomain](https://joss.techlm.co.uk/)

Even though most of her projects never go past the Alpha state, she always is working
 in new ways to inovate or reinvent what already exist with a very low knowledge of programming and high amounts of Hyperfocus.

 She was for a time a VTuber/Musician, but her lack of talent on it made her fall back to coding... and even though she also doesn't has any talent on coding too, 
 she somehow never gives up on it.
