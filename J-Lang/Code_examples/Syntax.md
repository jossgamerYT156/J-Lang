**this is J-Lang!**

J-Lang is a simple Pseudo Programming Language made with C for people who want to code, but don't know exactly where to start or how to use functions!

first of all, you have to know some terms!

Syntax:
is the way some code is formulated, example:
print("hello world)
we see that we are using J-Lang Syntax, or, the way to write J-Lang code.

check your syntax, since one error can cause for all the program to not run at all or skip steps!

____________________________________________________
J-Lang Syntax Rules:

print:
prints a given string.

syntax= print("something goes here.)
        print("something else goes here.)

msg:
comments a piece of data.
syntax= print("this is a printed message)
        msg("and this gets ignored.)

browser:
opens a website on your dedicated web browser.
syntax= print("a browser will open.)
        browser("https://www.something.com)
