# J-Lang
A simple Pseudo Programming Language written to be simple to use and do very basic tasks


# What is based J-Lang of?
Mostly from basic Python instructions, basically, a more simple Python where you actually have rules to write code.

# Is this a real programming language?
technically, it isn't, yet, since it is written in a real programming language and acts like one, can be taken as one!

# Why was this created?
mostly from pure boredom, yet it's very simple and helps to understand VERY basic programming mechanisms

# This was written on...
C, then i created some simple Syntax for the interpreter for you to actually have some logic on it.


again, this isn't a real programming language, and was made for pure entretainment purposes.
i don't intend to take the place of real developers doing real advancements.
have fun.
create.
and most importantly...
learn!
