# J-Lang

J-Lang is a simple pseudo-programming language designed for educational purposes and basic tasks.

## Inspiration

J-Lang draws inspiration from basic **Python** and **C** instructions, providing a simplified version with clear rules for writing code. It aims to be accessible to beginners and help users understand fundamental programming concepts.

## Development

J-Lang is written primarily in C, with a simple syntax interpreter designed to provide basic logic and functionality. While it's not a real programming language, it behaves similarly and can serve as a learning tool for new programmers or hobbists.

***Aclaration***
this does **NOT** intends to replace **any** real programming language.
this is made **just for fun** and aims for it to be a learning tool.

## Purpose

J-Lang is not intended to replace real programming languages or advance complex projects. Instead, it's meant for entertainment and learning purposes, offering a fun and approachable introduction to programming in a simple and understandable way.

Though J-Lang **will** at some point be ported as a real programming language for [J-OS](#J-OS), until then, this is just a fun project.

## Example

`print("Hello, world!)`

to run this code, see # Usage

what if we want to do something a bit more complex?

like making so it just outputs data and don't asks for user input?

for that we use the `activityClass` tag on the code, we use it at the start of the code.

`activityClass(inputO)`

**change `inputO` for one of the arguments available, these being:**
- inputO
Only gets input from the user, maybe for storing data or just saving files | will implement things like saveToFile and showInput later |

- outputO
Only outputs data like text lines, things like `print("hello world)` are the ones to be displayed | for now

- InOut
gets and shows both input and output | still in development.

**keep in mind, `activityClass` is still on development, and might not work as expected.**

# Usage

To run J-Lang code, compile the interpreter and execute it with the desired J-Lang file as an argument.

`./j-lang-interpreter example.jl`

## Background of J-Project

**What is the J-Project?**

The J-Project is a branding for all the projects linked to [J-OS](#J-OS) in a way, all made by LillyDev alone, or with her friends!
Examples of this are [J-Lang](#J-Lang) or J-OS itself.

for now the J-Project is conformed of only *TWO* github repos, both being Open Source and completely free to download and use.


# J-OS
J-OS, or Just Other System, is a project made by LillyDev, started by Techlm77, in order to create a full new Operative System which is mostly CLI based and easy to use while being low on resource usage.

J-OS started as a joke made by LillyDev while saying "if i can make this work, i will brag about it" yet advanced as a very possible project which made LillyDev start to work slightly more to it and to brand more projects with the J-Based branding.

nowadays, J-OS is on a `PAUSED` state, since Lilly has no idea how to make it work properly yet.

yet, even though J-OS doesn't work or is a Release yet... she keeps working on it and in projects like J-Lang or more.
